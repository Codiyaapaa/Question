Sliding Window Minimum
You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate the minimum of each window of k elements, from left to right.
In this problem the input data is large and it is created using a generator.
Input
The first line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window.
The next line contains four integers x, a, b and c: the input generator parameters. The input is generated as follows:

x1 = x
xi = (a * x(i-1) + b) mod c for i = 2, 3, ..., n

Output
Print the xor of all window minimums.
Constraints

1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ x, a, b ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9

Example
Input:
8 5
3 7 1 11

Output:
3

Explanation: The input array is [3,0,1,8,2,4,7,6]. The windows are [3,0,1,8,2], [0,1,8,2,4], [1,8,2,4,7] and [8,2,4,7,6], and their minimums are 0, 0, 1 and 2. Thus, the answer is 0 ⊕ 0 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 2 = 3.
