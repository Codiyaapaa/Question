You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to calculate the bitwise XOR of each window of k elements, from left to right.
In this problem the input data is large and it is created using a generator.

Input
The first line contains two integers n and k: the number of elements and the size of the window.
The next line contains four integers x, a, b and c: the input generator parameters.
The input is generated as follows:

x1 = x
xi = (a * x(i-1) + b) mod c for i = 2, 3, ..., n

Output
Print the XOR of all window XORs.

Constraints
1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ x, a, b ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9

Example
Input:

8 5
3 7 1 11


Output:

0


Explanation: The input array is [3, 0, 1, 8, 2, 4, 7, 6].
The windows are:
[3, 0, 1, 8, 2], [0, 1, 8, 2, 4], [1, 8, 2, 4, 7], [8, 2, 4, 7, 6]
Their XORs are 8, 15, 8, and 15.
Thus, the answer is 8 XOR 15 XOR 8 XOR 15 = 0.
